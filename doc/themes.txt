## Theme variable names:

- prefixed with “--T-”
- words are separated by hyphens
- “color” and “background[-color]” are abbreviated to “col” and “bg”
- should generally be structured like “--T-❬thing❭-❬property❭”
 - ex: “--T-link-col”, “--T-font-size”, “--T-quote-border-radius”, etc.
 

## Default theme

I've tried to choose colors that work with dark and light themes
(assuming you set `col` and `bg`)

If any new theme variables are added, their default values will always either:

- work on both light and dark backgrounds
  - ex: `--T-box-bg: #AAA2;` (`#AAA2` is `rgba(170, 170, 170, 0.133)`)

- be defined based on existing properties
  - ex: `--T-icode-col: var(--T-col);`

so existing themes won't need to be updated.
